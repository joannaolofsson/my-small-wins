## Small win tracker
Joanna Olofsson

In this tracker the user can register 3 things about their future self
One habit they like for their future self to have
An accomplishment they like to for their future self to have done
And finally a gift they would like to give their future self. 

# Track their small wins in relation to their future self 
To be accountable for their wishes for their future self they will track their wins
The aim is to notice their progress without measuring and creating rigid goals that might feel unattainable

# My plan ...
is to expand on this project and create more tools that supports the user in their strive to develop themself

# Small win tracker needs
...more gamification but not as hardcore checklists or habittrackers but gamification that gives the user a feeling for their progress through their own experience of winning.
...a functioning login. 
...more design with that will make the project look more alive for instance with micro animations
...enhance the api, with more encouranging words and icons

# What I learned from this project
...to focus on small progress for my own projects
...what a database can do
...the need for file structure
...that I have so much more to learn 

# What I wish I knew before this project
That I was going to be able to complete it
That I do have a stronger sense of work structure than before the project
That I have learned alot and I can begin to trust that

# Ideas of projects to add to this...
An energyplanner - How can you plan your week, month or perhaps year basted on your estimated energy level
A tool to make decisions
